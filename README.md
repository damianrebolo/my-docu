# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Deployment

```console
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
